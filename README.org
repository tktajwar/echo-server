#+TITLE: Echo Server with Rust and Tokio

Simple asynchronous echo server written in [[https://rust-lang.org/][Rust]] using the [[https://tokio.rs/][Tokio]]
runtime. This server listens for incoming TCP connections and echoes
any received message back to the client. This server can handle
multiple clients asynchronously.

* Example usage

After cloning the repository, build and run the package with
~cargo~. The server will bind a TCP listener to ~127.0.0.1:6142~.

#+begin_src shell
  cargo run
#+end_src

While the server is running, use ~telnet~ to establish connection to
the server. Any message sent to the server will be echoed back.

#+begin_src shell
  telnet 127.0.0.1 6142
  Trying 127.0.0.1...
  Connected to 127.0.0.1.
  Escape character is '^]'.
  hello
  hello
  I LOVE RUST

  Tokio makes life easier.
  Tokio makes life easier.
  ^]
  telnet> quit
  Connection closed.
#+end_src
